# Description for model evaluation on C-K edge spectra dataset

This repository contains scripts for model evaluation on C-K edge spectra dataset including training and analysis.

## Environment for training and evaluation

All scripts should be run in an appropriate Python environment where CUDA 11.8 is available on a GPU.

To create the Python environment we recommend to create a dedicated environment using conda.

You can use the package list files provided in `evaluation/scripts` for easy construction: 

```bash
git clone git@github.com:nmdl-mizo/isdpainn.git
cd isdpainn/evaluation/scripts
conda env create -f environment.yaml
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install deepchem # for scaffold split
```

Alternatively, run the following:

```bash
conda create -n isdpainn python=3.10 pytorch=2.1.0 torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.8 pyg=2.4.0 pytorch-scatter pytorch-sparse pytorch-cluster pytorch-spline-conv -c pytorch -c nvidia -c pyg
conda install -qy matplotlib tqdm scikit-learn seaborn
pip install wandb pymatgen
pip install git+https://github.com/Open-Catalyst-Project/ocp.git@v0.1.0#egg=ocp-models
pip install git+https://github.com/nmdl-mizo/isdpainn.git@main#egg=isdpainn
pip install "ck_edge_maker[pyg] @ git+https://github.com/nmdl-mizo/ck_edge_maker@v1.1.0"
pip install git+https://github.com/nmdl-mizo/castep_elnes_parser@v1.1.0#egg=ceparser
pip install deepchem # for scaffold split
```

## Dataset download

To run the scripts for evaluation, dataset must be downloaded.

The trained weights, settings, and MSE for each of the random and scaffold splits and the ablation experiment have been uploaded to zenodo.
The raw files for the rotated benzene and the CASTEP results for the aromatic amino acids are uploaded to NOMAD.
The files in zenodo and NOMAD can be downloaded by running `evaluation/scripts/download.py`.

Seperately, download the site-specific C-K edge spectra dataset named "site_spectra_0.5eV.hdf5" from [FigShare](https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/31947896) and place it under `evaluation/dataset/raw` directory.
This file contains the carbon K-edge spectra data smoothed by a Gaussian filter at 0.5 eV for each site including intensities corresponding to the x-, y-, and z-directions.
This data is published as related data in the prior literature [1].

### Code for preprocessing dataset

The structures of the molecules in the corresponding QM9 dataset [2, 3] were obtained using `torch_geometric.dataset.qm9.QM9` from the Python library [PyTorch Geometric](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric) [4].

In the actual validation experiment, a vector of 256 lengths sampled at equal intervals from 288eV to 310eV was interpolated and used for training after integration with the structural data.
The class `ck_edge_maker.dataset.CK`, which inherits from torch_geometric's InmemoryDataset, is available in the Python library [ck-edge-maker](https://github.com/nmdl-mizo/ck_edge_maker) on GitHub[5].

## Run training

The default model and training parameters are stored in "evaluation/scripts/config-defaults.yaml".

The code for training is "scripts/train.py".
To run the script, follow the procedure below:
1. Prepare Python environment following [here](#environment-for-training-and-evaluation).
1. Change directory to `evaluation/scripts/`
1. Check the model and training parameters in `config-defaults.yaml` and modify it if you need.
1. Run `./train.py -l`.
1. Files will be output.
    - checkpoint file (`model_state.pt`)
    - MSE of site- (`metric_dict.pt`)

## Trained model checkpoint

The weights of the trained model and MSE for random split and scaffold split discussed in the paper are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10547719.

The trained model weight can be loaded as follows:
```Python
from inspect import signature
import torch
from isdpainn import ISDPaiNN
from wandb.sdk.lib.config_util import dict_from_config_file
DEVICE = torch.device("cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
config = dict_from_config_file("config-defaults.yaml")
model = ISDPaiNN(**{
    key: value
    for key, value in config.items()
    if key in signature(ISDPaiNN).parameters.keys()
})
model_state_dict = torch.load("model_state.pt", map_location=DEVICE)
model.load_state_dict(
    model_state_dict["model_state_dict"]
)
```

## Time comparison between DFT and IDS-PaiNN

`evaluation/data/analyzed/time_mol_castep_vs_isdpainn.pkl` and `evaluation/scripts/plot_calculation_time_comparison.py` are the data and script for the calculation/prediction time for the C-K edge in the dataset by CASTEP code and IDS-PaiNN.
To reproduce the figure visualizing the dependency on molecular size, run the script in `evaluation/scripts` and `evaluation/figures/time_comparison.png` will be generated.

## Ablation experiments

To assess the contribution of individual components within our model, we conducted ablation experiments by selectively modifying components of ISD-PaiNN and comparing the resulting prediction accuracies.
Four distinct models were trained for the ablation experiments:

1. ISD-PaiNN
  The same model discussed and evaluated in the main text.

2. Without Symmetric Message Layer (w/o SM)
  This model omits the inversion symmetry and adopts the same message block as the original PaiNN.

3. Without Directional Embedding (w/o DE)
  In this model, node vector features are initialized with zero vectors, eliminating the directional embedding component present in the original PaiNN.

4. Without Symmetric Message Passing and Directional Embedding (w/o DE-SM)
  This model combines the modifications from both (2) and (3), removing both the symmetric message passing block and utilizing zero vector initialization for node vector features.
  This model is most similar to the original PaiNN model in terms of the message passing block and node vector feature initialization.
  The difference between this model and the original PaiNN model is the output block for predicting site-specific spectra.

The conversion from node-specific features to site-specific features is performed by the same output block as in ISD-PaiNN. Note that the original PaiNN model itself was not included in the ablation experiments, as its output is designed to predict energy or forces and is not tailored for predicting site-specific anisotropic spectra.
These ablation experiments were performed under random splitting conditions, utilizing the same training and test data as presented in the paper.

The configuration, weights, and MSEs of the models for the ablation experiments are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10566201.

To reproduce the scatter plot comparing the MSEs of these models, run `evaluation/scripts/compare_ablation.py` in a Python environment (see [here](#environment-for-training-and-evaluation)) with the dataset downloaded (see [here](#dataset-download)).
