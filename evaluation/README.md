## Description for model evaluation on C-K edge spectra dataset

## Dataset source and code for preprocessing dataset

The carbon K-edge spectra data were smoothed by a Gaussian filter at 0.5 eV for each site and include intensities in the x-, y-, and z-directions.
This data is published under the name "site_spectra_0.5eV.hdf5" as related data in the prior literature [1] at the following FigShare URL:
https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/31947896

The structures of the molecules in the corresponding QM9 dataset [2, 3] were obtained using `torch_geometric.dataset.qm9.QM9` from the Python library [PyTorch Geometric](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric) [4].

In the actual validation experiment, a vector of 256 lengths sampled at equal intervals from 288eV to 310eV was interpolated and used for training after integration with the structural data.
The class `ck_edge_maker.dataset.CK`, which inherits from torch_geometric's InmemoryDataset, is available in the Python library [ck-edge-maker](https://github.com/nmdl-mizo/ck_edge_maker) on GitHub[5].

## Training scripts

The code for training is described in "scripts/train.py".

## Model and training parameters

Model and training parameters are described in "scripts/config-defaults.yaml".

## Trained model checkpoint

The weights of the results trained under the conditions described in "scripts/config-defaults.yaml" are available at the following URL.
