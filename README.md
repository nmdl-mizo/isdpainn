# Inversion Symmetry-aware Directional PaiNN (ISD-PaiNN)

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/744791559.svg)](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10554764)

## Description
This model is proposed in a paper
[Open Review: iSFsLFsGYX](https://openreview.net/forum?id=iSFsLFsGYX), which was accepted in [AI for 
Accelerated Materials Design(AI4Mat) - NeurIPS 2023](https://sites.google.com/view/ai4mat/home) as a spot-light talk.

### Model
The model architecture is largely based on the Polarizable Atom Interaction Neural Network (PaiNN) proposed by Kristof T. Schütt, Oliver T. Unke, and Michael Gastegger in the paper:
"Equivariant message passing for the prediction of tensorial properties and molecular spectra"
[arXiv:2102.03150](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03150).

The main changes from the PaiNN model are as follows:
1. Input an orientation vector $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ in addition to molecular graph $\mathcal{G}$.
1. Non-zero initialization of node-wise equivariant vector feature $\vec{\mathbf{v}}_i^0$.
1. Symmetrized message block to satisfy the resultant equivariance and invariance of the features $\vec{\mathbf{v}}_i^l$ and $\mathbf{s}_i^l$ including spatial inversion on either $\mathcal{G}$ or $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$.

These changes enable to regress physical properties not only on molecular graph but also orientation relative to the graph.

### Code
The code is developed based on the implementation of PaiNN in [`ocp-models.models.painn`](https://github.com/Open-Catalyst-Project/ocp/tree/main/ocpmodels/models/painn).
